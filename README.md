# Food101

Built an Image Classifier that can differentiate between (and identify) 101 classes of Food. The Food101 dataset is taken from TensorFlow Datasets and is also available on Kaggle.

The model itself is built upon an EfficientNetB0 backbone which is the simplest model in the family, so there can be much room for improvement. As of now, the model has an accuracy of 79.5% on the Validation Set and reached a peak of 81% during Training. 

Intend to use StreamLit to make this an app.
